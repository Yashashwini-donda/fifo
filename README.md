Designing a FIFO Memory in xilinx vivado. With the knowledge of Computer Architechture and Organisation and the working and need of fifo memory, I designed a fifo memory by writing a behavioral verilog code. After the synthesis and implementation of the code withot any errors we get the desired design. In the code I mentioned abot the input and output ports of the fifo memory in the fifo module. Later on I defined the number of bits for each of the input and output based on the requirement. I mentioned about some conditions like FULL and EMPTY. Defined the conditins of operation of read and write block. Finally, I defined the conditions of a counter.
